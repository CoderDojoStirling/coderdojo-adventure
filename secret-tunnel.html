    <h1>The Secret Tunnel</h1>
    <p>The tunnel is dark and smells of rats. In fact, there's a rat right next to you, eating some cheese.</p>
    <p>You can hear water dripping from above.</p>
    <p>There's a light up ahead. And someone sitting below it. They're singing.</p>
    <p>You decide to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="walking.html">Walk towards</a> the singer, shouting 'hello'</li>
        <li>Pick up the rat and <a href="thrown-rat.html">throw it</a> at the singer</li>
    </ul>
    <br/>
