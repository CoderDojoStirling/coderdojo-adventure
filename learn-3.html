<h1>Adventure Part 3: Putting Your Adventure Online</h1>

<p>In the last two CoderDojo sessions, you created an adventure out of web-pages.</p>

<p>The web-pages were written in HTML (HyperText Markup Language).</p>

<p>We also used CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) to make the adventure look nice. You could make the page background red or the text blue.</p>

<p>This session, we're going to:
   <ul>
    <li>Put your adventure on the internet, so everyone can play it :-)</li>
    <li>Add some Javascript code to the adventure, to get some special effects</li>
    <li>Learn more about the Javascript programming language by playing someone else's adventure online. It's really cool.</li>
   </ul>
</p>

<h2>Putting Your Adventure on the Internet</h2>

<p>So far you created your adventure on your own computer - so only you can access it.</p>

<p>For other people to see your adventure, it needs to be on the Internet.</p>

<p>This means your adventure files (the web-pages and pictures) have to be 'uploaded' to a website on the Internet.</p>

<p>You can then give the 'web address' of your adventure to your friends and family, and they can play your adventure!</p>

<h3>An example adventure</h3>

<p>There's an example adventure already online for you to look at.</p>

<p>Your adventure will be just like it, except with its own special web address.</p>

<p>Open the following address in your web browser, and have a play:<br>
    <a href="http://coderdojostirling.neocities.org/coderdojo-adventure/start.html">http://coderdojostirling.neocities.org/coderdojo-adventure/start.html</a></p>

<h3>Putting Your Adventure Online</h3>

<p>Let's put your own adventure online.</p>

<p>First, make sure you have your adventure on your computer.</p>
<p>Don't have it? Download a new copy from <a href="http://tiny.cc/coderdojo-adventure">http://tiny.cc/coderdojo-adventure</a></p>

<p>Next, go to <a href="https://neocities.org">https://neocities.org</a> (when you can create a free website):
    <ul>
        <li>Sign up: give the name you want for your website, your email address and password.</li>
        <li>Choose the 'Free' option</li>
        <li>Click on the red 'Edit Site' button</li>
        <li>Click on the 'New Folder' button, and create one called 'coderdojo-adventure'</li>
        <li>Click on the 'coderdojo-adventure' folder, on the 'Manage' link</li>
        <li>Click on the 'Upload' button, and select all the adventure files from your computer (webpages and images)</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<p>If everything went to plan, your adventure is now on the Internet!</p>

<p>Let's find the web address of your adventure.</p>

<p>In the 'coderdojo-adventure' folder on the Neocities website, click on the start.html file: it should open up in a new browser window.</p>

<p>You should be on the start page of your adventure, and it's on the Internet!</p>

<p>Look at web address at the top of your browser: this is the web address of your adventure that you can share with your friends and family.</p>

<p>Now go show a mentor. They can put a link to your adventure on the <a href="https://coderdojostirling.neocities.org/">CoderDojo Stirling webpage</a>.</p>

<h3>You Now Have Your Own Website!</h3>

<p>You now have your own website on the Internet.</p>

<p>Its web address is something like: http://your-chosen-name.neocities.org</p>

<p>Your adventure is in the folder http://your-chosen-name.neocities.org/coderdojo-adventure/...</p>

<p>But you can create other folders with other web-pages in them.</p>

<p>You can create and edit new folders and web-pages by clicking the red 'New Page' and 'New Folder' buttons on the Neocities website.</p>

<p>Or you can create web-pages on your own computer, and upload them using the 'Upload' button - like you just did with your adventure.</p>

<h2>Adding Special Effects to Web-pages with Javascript</h2>

<p>All websites (like your adventure) involve three main technologies:
    <ul>
        <li>HTML (HyperText Markup Language): for writing the web-pages (content)</li>
        <li>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets): for making the web-pages look nice (styling)</li>
        <li>Javascript code: for making things happen on your web-pages (special effects, games, anything!)</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<p>Let's add some </p>
