<h1>How to Keep Writing This Adventure</h1>

<p>This adventure is a number of web-pages linked together.</p>

<p>To finish it, you'll need to change the existing web-pages and add some new ones.</p>

<h2>What a Web-page is</h2>

<p>A web-page is a special type of document. It's written in HTML: HyperText Markup Language.</p>

<p>A web-page can contain different 'elements': like headings, paragraphs, images and links to other web-pages.</p>

<p>You define what elements should appear in the web-page using HTML.</p>

<p>When you open the web-page in your browser, the browser reads the page's HTML, and shows the defined elements.</p>

<h2>Challenge 1: update a web-page to add your name</h2>

<p>It's time to change a web-page in the adventure.</p>

<p>Let's update the adventure <a href="start.html">'start' web-page</a>.</p>

<p>It's your adventure, so we'll change the page to say 'by Your Name', rather than 'by Greg'!</p>

<p>
    First of all, you need to open the start web-page in an HTML editor program (ask a mentor if you need help):
    <ol>
        <li>Sublime Text is a good editor. You can install it from <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/3">http://www.sublimetext.com/3</a>.
            <ul>
                <li>If you don't have permission to install new software, try Notepad on Windows.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Now find the start.html file on your computer, and open it with the HTML editor.
            <ul>
                <li>The start.html file should be in the 'coderdojo-adventure-master' folder you downloaded and opened.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>
</p>

<h3>Web-page structure</h3>

<p>In your HTML editor, The 'start' web-page HTML looks like this:<xmp>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>CoderDojo - Choose Your Own Adventure</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>Choose Your Own Adventure</h1>
        <h2>By Greg</h2>
        <p>You are in a room.</p>
        <p>In front of you are some doors.</p>
        <p>You decide to:
        <ul>
            <li><a href="no-chickens.html">Go through</a> the door marked 'No Chickens Allowed'</li>
            <li><a href="secret-tunnel.html">Go through</a> the door marked 'Secret Tunnel'</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
    </body>
</html>
</xmp></p>

<p>The HTML defines the different 'elements' that make up the page: like headers, paragraphs and links.<p>
<p>Each 'element' is made up of a start 'tag' and an end 'tag', and some text in between.</p>
<p>See this line? <xmp><h2>By Greg</h2></xmp></p>

<p>This is HTML for 'header' ('h2' is for header of size '2'). This tells the web-browser to display the text 'By Greg' as a heading, in big, bold text. Like this:</p>

<h2>By Greg</h2>

<p>Now change this 'h2' to have your name, rather than 'Greg'. So if you were called Tim, it would be: <xmp><h2>By Tim</h2></xmp>

<p>Now save the start.html in your HTML editor, and reload the same file in your web browser.</p>

<p>If you were called Tim, the start page should now say:</p>

<h2>by Tim</h2>

<p>You just changed your first HTML webpage. Nice!</p>

<h2>Challenge 2: create a new web-page</h2>

<p>Let's add another door to the 'start' web-page of your adventure. It will point to a new web-page you can edit:
    <ol>
        <li>Make sure the 'start.html' file is open in your HTML editor again.</li>
        <li>Now, find this line:<xmp><li><a href="secret-tunnel.html">Go through</a> the door marked 'Secret Tunnel'</li></xmp></li>
        <li>Add this line right after: <xmp><li><a href="haunted-house.html">Go through</a> the door marked 'Haunted House'</li></xmp></li>
        <li>Save the start.html file in your HTML editor, and reload the same file in your web browser.</li>
        <li>There should be a new line at the bottom of the web-page, about a Haunted House.</li>
        <li>Click on the 'Haunted House' link on that line.</li>
    </ol>
</p>

<p>Oh no! Things have gone wrong in your web browser.</p>

<p>Either the browser is showing an error message, or everything is blank.</p>

<p>What's the problem? Well, you just added some HTML that creates a link to a new web-page called 'haunted-house.html' (that's the 'a href=haunted-house.html' bit)</p>

<p>Your browser is complaining, as the haunted-house.html web-page doesn't exist yet.</p>

<p>Now it's time for you to create the 'Haunted House' web-page:
    <ol>
        <li>Look in the 'coderdojo-adventure-master' folder where all your adventure files are.</li>
        <li>Find a file called new-webpage.html</li>
        <li>Copy that file, and paste it into the same folder, making sure the new file is called haunted-house.html</li>
        <li>Now reload your web browser (which should still be trying to open haunted-house.html)</li>
        <li>You should now be seeing a new web-page. If not, ask a mentor for help.</li>
    </ol>
</p>

<p>You have just created your first web-page. Well done!</p>

<h2>Challenge 3: change the Haunted House web page</h2>

<p>You just created a new web-page called haunted-house.html.</p>

<p>So what should happen when someone enters the Haunted House in your adventure?</p>

<p>You decide: go edit the haunted-house.html file in your HTML editor.</p>

<p>Once you've made some changes, remember to save the file, and then reload it in your web browser.</p>

<p>Below is a list of HTML elements you can use.</p>

<h3>Different HTML elements</h3>

<h4>- Paragraph -</h4>

<p>A paragraph is some text with space before and after.</p>

<p>Here's an example paragraph in HTML:
<br/>
    <xmp><p>'You are in a room.'</p></xmp>
</p>

<p>And here's what it looks like when loaded in the web-browser:
<p>'You are in a room.'</p>
</p>

<h4>- Header -</h4>

<p>A 'header' element is a heading: it shows text in big and bold.</p>

<p>Here's an example header in HTML:
    <br/>
    <xmp><h1>I am a header</h1></xmp>
</p>

<p>And here's what it looks like when loaded in the web-browser:
    <h1>I am a header</h1>
</p>

<p>There are different sizes of header: try h1, h2, h3, ...</p>

<h4>- Lists -</h4>

<p>The list element is useful for writing a list of choices in your adventure.<p>

<p>Use the 'ul' element for that. It's a bit different, because each item in the list is also an element: called 'li' (for 'list item')</p>

<p>Here's an example list in HTML:
    <xmp>
    <ul>
        <li>Eat the rat</li>
        <li>Throw the rat</li>
    </ul>
    </xmp>
</p>

<p>And here's what it looks like in the web-browser:
<ul>
    <li>Eat the rat</li>
    <li>Throw the rat</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h4>- Links -</h4>

<p>So you want to link to another web-page in the adventure?</p>

<p>You'll need the 'a' element for that (no idea why it's called 'a')</p>

<p>Here's an example link in HTML:
    <br/>
    <xmp><a href="secret-tunnel.html">Enter the secret tunnel</a></xmp>
</p>

<p>And here's what it looks like when loaded in the web-browser:
    <br/><br/>
    <a href="secret-tunnel.html">Enter the secret tunnel</a>
</p>

<h2>Challenge 4: Adding pictures</h2>

<p>Your adventure would probably look cooler if it had pictures.</p>

<p>Go and add some.</p>

<p>Use the 'img' element for that. It's a lot like the 'a' link element: but you're linking to a picture rather than another web-page.</p>

<p>Here's an example image in HTML:
    <xmp>
        <img src="robot.png"></img>
    </xmp>
</p>

<p>And here's what it looks like in the web-browser:
<ul>
    <img src="robot.png"></img>
</ul>
</p>

<p>You can create and save new images here: <a href="http://drawisland.com/?w=400&h=400">http://drawisland.com/?w=400&h=400</a></p>

<p>Or use a drawing editor on your computer to create something (like Paint on Windows). Ask a mentor for help with this.</p>

<p>Either way, save the image to the same folder as the adventure html pages - then you can link to it using the 'img' element.</p>

<h2>Challenge 5: Learn more about web-pages</h2>

<p>We hope you had fun creating an adventure with simple web-pages.</p>

<p>Now it's time to learn more about web-pages.</p>

<p>Try working through the two online courses at Khan Academy
