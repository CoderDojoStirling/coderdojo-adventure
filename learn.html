<h1>How to Keep Writing This Adventure</h1>

<p>This adventure is a number of web-pages linked together.</p>

<p>To finish it, you'll need to change the existing web-pages and add some new ones.</p>

<h2>What a Web-page is</h2>

<p>A web-page is a special type of document. It's written in HTML: HyperText Markup Language.</p>

<p>A web-page can contain different 'elements': like headings, paragraphs, images and links to other web-pages.</p>

<p>You define what elements should appear in the web-page using HTML.</p>

<p>When you open the web-page in your browser, the browser reads the page's HTML, and shows the defined elements.</p>

<h2>Updating a web-page: Let's add another door</h2>

<p>It's time to change a web-page in the adventure.</p>

<p>Let's say you want to update the <a href="start.html">'start' web-page</a> of the adventure.</p>
<p>We'll add another door that says 'Enter if you dare'.</p>

<p>
    First of all, you need to open the start web-page in a text editor (ask a mentor if you need help):
    <ol>
        <li>Start a text editor (use Notepad on Windows).
            <ul>
                <li>On a Mac, try TextWrangler. You can install it from <a href="http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/download.html">here</a></li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Now find the start.html file on your computer, and open it with the text editor</li>
    </ol>
</p>

<h3>Web-page structure</h3>

The web-page HTML looks something like this:

<xmp>
<html>

    <title>CoderDojo - Choose Your Own Adventure</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Choose Your Own Adventure</h1>
    <h2>By Greg</h2>
    <p>You are in a room.</p>
    <p>In front of you are two doors. The left door says 'No Chickens Allowed' on it. The right door says 'Secret Tunnel'.</p>
    <p>You decide to:
        <ul>
            <li><a href="no-chickens.html">Go through</a> the door marked 'No Chickens Allowed'</li>
            <li><a href="secret-tunnel.html">Go through</a> the door marked 'Secret Tunnel'</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
</body>
</html>
</xmp>

<p>The HTML defines the different 'elements' that make up the page: like headers, paragraphs and links.<p>
<p>Each 'element' is made up of a start 'tag' and an end 'tag', and some text in between.</p>
<p>See this line? <xmp><p>You are in a room.</p></xmp></p>
<p>This is HTML for 'paragraph' ('p' for paragraph). This tells the web-browser to display the text 'You are in a room' as a paragraph. So the browser shows this text with some empty space above and below it.</p>
<p>Before we add our new 'Enter if you dare' door, let's look at the different HTML elements you can use in your adventure web-pages.</p>

<h3>- Paragraph -</h3>

<p>We've already talked about the 'paragraph' element, but to repeat ourself...</p>

<p>Here's an example paragraph in HTML:
<br/>
    <xmp><p>'You are in a room.'</p></xmp>
</p>

<p>And here's what it looks like when loaded in the web-browser:
<p>'You are in a room.'</p>
</p>

<h3>- Header -</h3>

<p>A 'header' element is useful for chapter or section headings in your adventure.</p>

<p>Here's an example header in HTML:
    <br/>
    <xmp><h1>Choose Your Own Adventure</h1></xmp>
</p>

<p>And here's what it looks like when loaded in the web-browser:
    <h1>Choose Your Own Adventure</h1>
</p>

<p>There are different sizes of header: try h1, h2, h3, ...</p>

<h3>- Lists -</h3>

<p>The list element is useful for writing a list of choices in your adventure.<p>

<p>Use the 'ul' element for that. It's a bit different, because each item in the list is also an element: called 'li' (for 'list item')</p>

<p>Here's an example list in HTML:
    <xmp>
    <ul>
        <li>Eat the rat</li>
        <li>Throw the rat</li>
    </ul>
    </xmp>
</p>

<p>And here's what it looks like in the web-browser:
<ul>
    <li>Eat the rat</li>
    <li>Throw the rat</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>- Links -</h3>

<p>So you want to link to another web-page in the adventure?</p>

<p>You'll need the 'a' element for that (no idea why it's called 'a')</p>

<p>Here's an example link in HTML:
    <br/>
    <xmp><a href="secret-tunnel.html">Enter the secret tunnel</a></xmp>
</p>

<p>And here's what it looks like when loaded in the web-browser:
    <br/><br/>
    <a href="secret-tunnel.html">Enter the secret tunnel</a>
</p>

<h2>Challenge 1: Adding another door for real</h2>

<p>Now we're ready to add another door saying 'Enter if you dare' on it (to the start of the adventure):
<ol>
    <li>Make sure start.html is open in your text editor</li>
    <li>Replace the paragraph starting 'In front of you are two doors..' with:<xmp>
<p>In front of you are three doors.
   The left door says 'No Chickens Allowed' on it.
   The middle door says 'Secret Tunnel'.
   The right door says 'Enter if you dare'</p></xmp></li>
    <li>Replace the list of decisions with:
        <xmp><ul>
            <li><a href="no-chickens.html">Go through</a> the door marked 'No Chickens Allowed'</li>
            <li><a href="secret-tunnel.html">Go through</a> the door marked 'Secret Tunnel'</li>
            <li><a href="enter-if-you-dare.html">Go through</a> the door marked 'Enter if you dare'</li>
        </ul></xmp>
    </li>
    <li>Save start.html, and reload it in your web browser.</li>
</ol>

<p>Great - you've added another door to the adventure!

<h2>Challenge 2: Filling out the adventure</h2>

<p>It's time to fill out the adventure.</p>
<p>There are 4 existing web-pages that need changing to make this a real adventure.</p>
<p>Open each page in your text editor, and change it (like you just did with start.html):
    <ul>
        <li><a href="i-am-a-chicken.html">i-am-a-chicken.html</a> (got to from <a href="no-chickens.html">no-chickens.html)</a></li>
        <li><a href="i-am-not-a-chicken.html">i-am-not-a-chicken.html</a> (got to from <a href="no-chickens.html">no-chickens.html)</a></li>
        <li><a href="walk-and-hello.html">walk-and-hello.html</a> (got to from <a href="secret-tunnel.html">secret-tunnel.html)</a></li>
        <li><a href="thrown-rat.html">thrown-rat.html</a> (got to from <a href="secret-tunnel.html">secret-tunnel.html)</a></li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>In Challenge 1, you just linked to a page that doesn't exist yet: <a href="enter-if-you-dare.html">enter-if-you-dare.html</a>.</p>
<p>You'll need to create that page too: the easiest way is to copy and paste an existing HTML file (like thrown-rat.html), and rename it to enter-if-you-dare.html</p>

<p>Then change enter-if-you-dare.html to what you want: what's behind the 'Enter if you dare' door? A giant squid? A volcano?</p>

<p>Spend as much time as you want in writing your adventure.</p>

<p>And get someone else to play it :-)</p>

<h2>Challenge 3: Adding pictures</h2>

<p>Your adventure would probably look cooler if it had pictures.</p>

<p>Go and add some.</p>

<p>Use the 'img' element for that. It's a lot like the 'a' link element: but you're linking to a picture rather than another web-page.</p>

<p>Here's an example image in HTML:
    <xmp>
        <img src="robot.png"></img>
    </xmp>
</p>

<p>And here's what it looks like in the web-browser:
<ul>
    <img src="robot.png"></img>
</ul>
</p>

<p>You can create and save new images here: <a href="http://drawisland.com/?w=400&h=400">http://drawisland.com/?w=400&h=400</a></p>

<p>Or use a drawing editor on your computer to create something (like Paint on Windows). Ask a mentor for help with this.</p>

<p>Either way, save the image to the same folder as the adventure html pages - then you can link to it using the 'img' element.</p>

<h2>Challenge 4: Learn more about web-pages</h2>

<p>We hope you had fun creating an adventure with simple web-pages.</p>

<p>Now it's time to learn more about web-pages.</p>

<p>Try working through the two online courses at Khan Academy
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/hour-of-code/hour-of-html/v/making-webpages-intro">Hour of Web-pages</a> (takes one hour, for age 8+)</li>
        </li><a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/html-css">HTML/CSS: Making webpages (a longer course)</a></li>
    </ul>
