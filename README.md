# Choose Your Own Adventure lesson plan

This is a CoderDojo lesson plan and materials. It's all about building a 'Choose Your Own Adventure' using basic web-pages. Hopefully the kids will then be motivated to learn more about HTML/CSS. There are some follow-on Khan Academy courses suggested at the end.

## Setup

Each kid's computer will need:
* A text editor (for editing basic HTML files)
  * On Windows, Notepad is just fine. Or try [Notepad++](http://notepad-plus-plus.org/download)
  * On Mac, try [TextWrangler](http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/download.html). Don't use TextEdit (you can't edit raw HTML with it)
* A image editor (for creating basic images)
  * On Windows, Paint is just fine.
  * Although, for preference, vector drawing tools are nicer

Then on the computer..:
* Download this (zipped) project from [here](https://github.com/greghuc/coderdojo-cyoa/archive/master.zip).
  * Alternatively, here's the more fun shortened link: [http://bit.do/coderdojo-adventure](http://bit.do/coderdojo-adventure)
* Unzip the project into a folder
* In a web-browser, open start.html (in the unzipped project)
* Get the kid to follow the instructions in start.html :-)
* At various points, you might need to help them with:
  * Opening an (existing) html file in the text editor, and editing it.
  * Creating a new html file and editing it (copy n paste an existing file).
  * Creating a new image in the image editor, and saving it to the project folder.

That's it!

Two suggestions for you as a CoderDojo mentor:
* Run through the lesson yourself to get a feel for what's involved.
* Open learn.html in a web-browser, and print a bunch of copies for all the kids attending. This is not strictly necessary (as the kids can read the page in their browsers), but should simplify matters as they have a paper copy of the instructions to refer to.
