# Choose Your Own Adventure lesson plan

This is a CoderDojo lesson plan and materials. It's all about building a 'Choose Your Own Adventure' using basic web-pages. Hopefully the kids will be motivated to learn more about HTML/CSS/Javascript.

There are 3 lessons. Print out the following files for each lesson, and give them to the kids:
* Lesson one: setup.html and learn.html
* Lesson two: learn-2.html
* Lesson three: learn-3.html

## Setup

Each kid's computer will need:
* A text editor (for editing basic HTML files). Try [Sublime Text 3](http://www.sublimetext.com/3)
  * As a fallback on Windows, try Notepad.
* A image editor (for creating basic images)
  * On Windows, Paint is just fine.
  * Although, for preference, vector drawing tools are nicer

For the first lesson (on their computer..):
* Follow the instructions in setup.html, which are:
  * Download this (zipped) project from [here](https://github.com/greghuc/coderdojo-adventure/archive/master.zip).
    * Alternatively, here's the more fun shortened link: [http://tiny.cc/coderdojo-adventure](http://tiny.cc/coderdojo-adventure)
  * Unzip the project into a folder (the default name is likely 'coderdojo-adventure-master')
  * In a web-browser, open start.html (in the folder)
  * Get the kid to follow the instructions in start.html :-)
* At various points, you might need to help them with:
  * Opening an (existing) html file in the text editor, and editing it.
  * Creating a new html file and editing it (copy n paste the existing new-webpage.html file).
  * Creating a new image in the image editor, and saving it to the project folder.

That's it! Lessons two and three follow on from lesson (which did all the setup).

As a CoderDojo mentor it's best to run through the lessons yourself to get a feel for what's involved.
