<h1>Improving Your Adventure</h1>

<p>This session, you're going to improve the adventure you created last time.</p>

<p>First, you need to learn more about HTML and CSS.<p>

<p>You used HTML to create web-pages in your adventure.</p>
<p>You will use CSS to make the pages look nice.</p>

<h2>Khan Academy Course</h2>

<p>Go do the Khan Academy course called 'Hour of Webpages':<br><br>
    <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/hour-of-code/hour-of-html">https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/hour-of-code/hour-of-html</a></p>

<p>The course takes an hour or less to do.</p>

<p>If you get stuck, then ask a mentor.</p>

<h2>HTML Challenges</h2>

<p>So you finished the course on HTML?</p>

<p>Let's see how good you are.</p>

<p>Make sure you have your adventure on your computer.</p>
<p>Don't have it? Download a new copy from <a href="http://tiny.cc/coderdojo-adventure">http://tiny.cc/coderdojo-adventure</a></li>
</p>
<p>Make sure your adventure web-pages contain lots of HTML:
    <ol>
        <li><h4>2 or more headers, using: </h4><xmp><h1> - <h6></xmp></li>
        <li>2 pieces of <strong>important</strong> text, using: <xmp><strong></xmp></li>
        <li>2 pieces <em>emphasised</em> text, using: <xmp><em></xmp></li>
        <li>2 or more line breaks, using: <xmp><br></xmp></li>
        <li>2 or more paragraphs</li>
        <li>2 or more hyperlinks to other pages</li>
        <li>2 or more images with alt, width and height attributes set</li>
        <li>An ordered list</li>
        <li>An unordered list</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>And make sure you've got some CSS:
<ol>
    <li>2 or more webpages have background colors, using the background-color style</li>
    <li>Some headers and some paragraph have coloured text, using the color-style</li>
</ol>
Stuck? - ask a mentor for help.
</p>

<h2>Becoming More Awesome With CSS</h2>

<p>You'll need to learn CSS for that.</p>
